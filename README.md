## Compatibility:

<ol>
    <li>Not all bonuses are shown with leonardfactory's policy yield preview mod, as seen in some of the above screenshots. The two are still compatible and having both will not impact gameplay, the only impact is this visual bug.</li>
</ol>

## Latest Update:

<ol>
    <li>Adjusted attributes to match the strength of the attribute trees in update 1.2.5. Changed some attributes for flavor.</li>
</ol>
