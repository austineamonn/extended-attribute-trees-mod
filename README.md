## Goals:

<ol>
    <li>Add 5 additional attributes to the remaining 3 attribute trees</li>
</ol>

## Compatibility:

<ol>
    <li>Not all bonuses are shown with leonardfactory's policy yield preview mod [link here](https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/leonardfactorys-policy-yield-previews.32012/), as seen in some of the above screenshots. The two are still compatible and having both will not impact gameplay, the only impact is this visual bug.</li>
